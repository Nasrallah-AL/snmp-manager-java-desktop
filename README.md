# SNMP Manager Desktop Application

Welcome to the SNMP Manager Desktop Application project repository! This application provides a user-friendly interface for managing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) devices and monitoring network performance. Built using Java for the desktop application, Apache Tomcat and Servlet for authentication, and PHP server for SNMP communication, this application offers a comprehensive solution for network administrators.

## Features

- üíª **Desktop Application**: User-friendly interface for managing SNMP devices and monitoring network performance.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Authentication with Tomcat/Servlet**: Secure authentication mechanism implemented using Apache Tomcat and Servlet.
- üåê **PHP Server for SNMP Communication**: PHP server handles SNMP communication, enabling efficient management of SNMP devices.
- üìä **Network Performance Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of network performance metrics, such as bandwidth usage, packet loss, and device status.
- üìà **Graphical Representation**: Graphical representation of network data with charts and graphs for easy analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for the desktop application.
- **Apache Tomcat**: Servlet container for hosting the authentication server.
- **Servlet**: Java servlets used for handling authentication requests.
- **PHP**: Server-side scripting language for handling SNMP communication.

## Installation

To set up the SNMP Manager Desktop Application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed for running the desktop application.
3. Set up Apache Tomcat and deploy the authentication servlet.
4. Configure the PHP server for SNMP communication and ensure it's accessible to the desktop application.
5. Start Apache Tomcat and the PHP server.
6. Launch the desktop application and configure it to connect to the PHP server for SNMP communication.

## Usage

Once the application is set up, users can log in securely using the authentication mechanism provided by Apache Tomcat and Servlet. They can then manage SNMP devices, monitor network performance, and analyze data using the graphical representation features.
